# Stockholm SST Archive - Architecture

## Overview

The architecture leverages the work done on the SOLARNET SVO (##insert link##).
The archive is built on top of the Django framework which provides structures 
for describing the database, how to interact with it using the Django ORM and
a framework for generating HTML pages through views.

## TODO

Write about:

 * Apps and their purposes
 * Models inside of apps and how they interact with each other
