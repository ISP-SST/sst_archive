# Observations

## Overview

This app provides some of the core models for storing observations in the system, including:

* __DataCube__ - Describing basic information about a single FITS file in the system
* __Instrument__ - Describing an instrument with which the FITS file was captured
* __Tag__ - A keyword that can be attached as a classifier to one or more DataCube
