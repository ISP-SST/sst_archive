# Frontend

This Django app hosts the majority of the stuff that you see on screen when you use the service.

It uses old-school Django templates to generate static HTML views from queries to the database. This
is not a very modern type of web development and should probably be replaced with a JavaScript-based
frontend that makes use of a backend API to get the data to present.
