# Stockholm SST Archive

## Overview

This repo contains a searchable database of the science data produced using the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST).

A good place to start getting to know the inner workings of the SST Archive is to have a look at the
[system concepts](./docs/SYSTEM_CONCEPTS.md) and [architecture documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) documents.
